These programs are released courtesy of BP. They were originally written
by Joe Dellinger in 1997 at the former Amoco Tulsa Technology Center, released
informally in April 2000, and then reworked for more formal release in
March 2005. I would appreciate acknowledgement if you find them useful.
If you want to include this code in some package you are distributing,
then please acknowledge where the code came from, and how what you
are distributing varies from what I distributed.

These programs should work on anything with a reasonable C compiler.

What's here?:

titest, orthotest

What they do:
Titest and orthotest are programs for calculating how close to
transversely isotropic or orthorhombic a set of 21 elastic constants are.
General anisotropy requires 21 velocity parameters to describe.
Orthorhombic media have 3 perpendicular planes of symmetry, and require 9.
Transversely isotropic ("TI") has an axis of rotational symmetry and
requires only 5. There is no proprietary information in these programs;
they merely implement equations described in a paper by Patrick Rasolofosaon
of IFP. (Note there are typos in some equations listed in that paper.)
Those equations define a "distance" measure between two sets of 21 elastic
constants. The only "tricky" coding in these programs is how I do the
search over all possible orientations of the anisotropic symmetry axes.

What they are useful for:
These programs are mostly useful for testing and debugging various other
programs for manipulating and/or inverting elastic constants.

These programs accept as input 21 elastic constants, and output the nearest
TI and orthorhombic equivalents.

To test:

titest < TI_TEST_INPUT

Here is an example of program "titest". The input is in fact TI, but
its coordinate system has been rotated to obscure this fact. The
constants have been (accidentally) perturbed and rotated from constants

Cretaceous shales from the Williston Basin: GEOPHYSICS, 46, 288-297.

Here is an example of program "orthotest". This example comes from a
paper by Robert Vestrum, then at the University of Calgary:
Vestrum, R., Brown, J., and Easley, D. T., 1996,
From group or phase velocities to the general anisotropic stiffness tensor,
in Seismic Anisotropy, edited by J. Rathore, p. 101-140, published by the SEG.

Rob measured 21 elastic constants for a laboratory sample, a synthetic
medium made of resin and burlap that was designed to have orthorhombic
symmetry. This program finds that his elastic constants are indeed very
close to being orthorhombic and shows the orientation of the sample.
If the medium was in fact not only orthorhombic but TI, this program also
detects that by trying out each orthorhombic symmetry axis to see how
well it works as a TI axis of symmetry.

In this example we see the medium is not terribly orthorhombic... one of
the orthorhombic axes found is quite close to also being a TI symmetry axis.
